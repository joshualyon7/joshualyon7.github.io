                    <p>
                        I've explored a lot of different career paths during my time at UD. Of them, some of the 
                        ones I most see myself doing are...
                    </p>
                    <table>
                        <tr>
                            <td>Software Engineering</td>
                            <td>
                                My experience with general software engineering projects is varied. I've done everything from creating a 
                                <a href="https://github.com/ud-cis-discord/SageV2">Discord bot</a> for my school to government contracting work
                                during an internship with Northrop Grumman. You can learn about those and more <a href="projects.html">over here,</a>
                                but the main takeaway is that I have a passion for creating software, no matter the context or language.

                            <td>Teaching</td>
                            <td>
                                Teaching is one of the most satisfying things I've had the pleasure of doing while in school. I've TA'd for multiple 
                                courses and taught band at many high schools. I had many great teachers throughout my education and would love to get
                                the opportunity to give some of that back.

                        <tr>
                            <td>Research</td>
                            <td>
                                Research is something I'm not as familiar with, only having done a semester of it in High Performance Computing at UD. 
                                Pushing the boundaries of what has been done is a very attractive concept, and I would be grateful to work on the 
                                cutting edge of technology. 
                            </td>

                            <td>Dev Ops</td>
                            <td>
                                I adore workflows. The first thing I do when I start up a new project is think about how I'll organize my workflow. Going 
                                into Dev-Ops would be a dream come true! When working on UD's Discord bot, Sage, I set up a Jenkins pipeline to deploy it, 
                                and getting that working was the most satisfying thing in the world.
